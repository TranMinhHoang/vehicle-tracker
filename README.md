# vehicle-tracker
A simple example on detect and track trucks

###Summary
This is an example of truck detection and tracking using opencv and dlib on Qt
The default object detector is YOLO network
SSD networks are included in the project but they are not working as expected

###used library:
[opencv](https://opencv.org)
[Qt](https://www.qt.io)
[dlib](http://dlib.net)
